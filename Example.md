# Summary

The 1% rule is a simple but effective way to improve your content creation skills. The rule involves putting yourself on a publishing schedule and focusing on getting 1% better in an area that interests you with each piece of content you create. The goal is not perfection, but rather continuous improvement.

The rule is important because it helps creators overcome perfectionism and the taste gap, and it encourages them to put in the necessary work to close the gap between their current skill level and their ambitions.

# Transcript

Since 2014, my YouTube channel has gained more than 2.5 million subscribers and over 160 million views. I've learned a lot of lessons in that time, and I have several rules that I believe have contributed to my channel's growth. This is the number one rule.

If I could only share one piece of advice with you, it would be this one. I call it the 1% rule. Here it is.

Put yourself on a publishing schedule. Daily, weekly, once a month, whatever it is, the right schedule for you is going to vary, but having a schedule is key. For each piece of content that you create, focus on getting 1% better in an area that interests you.

That's it. The rule is simple and allows you to do things that are fun every time you pick up the camera or hook up the mic or start typing. Regardless of medium or niche, you can follow the 1% rule.

Here's why the 1% rule is so important. When I first started trying to make videos, I wasted a ton of time for one reason in particular, perfectionism. I felt that I needed to create the perfect first video, but there was one problem.

All the creators I was watching at the time had expensive cameras and lenses. Their backgrounds were full of blurry, creamy bokeh. Their microphones were super expensive.

They had nice lighting and background props, and I didn't have any of this expensive gear, and I felt like I couldn't make the perfect video until I had it. Well, I was right about part of that. I couldn't, and I still can't make the perfect video, but guess what?

No one else can either. Perfection is unattainable. In fact, even good enough is hard to achieve.

Ira Glass, the famed host of This American Life, a podcast, calls this the taste gap. You're a creative, you have great taste, but since you haven't actually made a whole lot of stuff yet, at least in this new niche of yours, you can't create art that's up to your taste standards. So here's the whole quote.

It is worth reading or listening to in this case and re-listening to in this case. Nobody tells people who are beginners, and I wish someone told me, all of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste, but there's this gap. For the first couple of years you make stuff, it's just not that good.

It's trying to be good. It has potential, but it's not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer, and your taste is why your work disappoints you.

A lot of people never get past this phase. They quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this.

We know our work doesn't have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. If you are just starting out, or you're still in this phase, you've got to know it's normal, and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work.

Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I've ever met.

It's going to take a while. It's normal to take a while. You just got to fight your way through.

Okay, that's the whole quote, and let me repeat that in case you're half listening to this on your phone while binging a Netflix show. I see you, Derek. You only gain skill as a creator by doing a huge volume of work.

You have got to put in the reps, and the reps only help you improve if you're challenging yourself each time. Both ingredients have to be there, repetition and challenge. In the weightlifting world, we call this progressive overload.

The muscles grow through repetitions and constantly increasing weights. The same thing happens with creative skill, hence the 1% rule. Six years ago, I made one video for my channel, and two years ago, I made another video for my channel.

You can see these two videos on the page that contains the text I'm currently narrating for you, and you can see a very marked difference in production quality. Okay, so now we need to talk about second order incompetence. There are two types of things you don't know, things you know you don't know, and things you don't know that you don't know.

The latter type, those things that you don't even know you don't know, are called second order incompetence, or at least the type of not knowing is. And you will always have a lot of this type of incompetence, but you have a huge amount of it when you're in the beginning stages of your journey as a creator. Here are five things I didn't know when I started as a YouTuber.

Number one, putting a hair light above you will create really nice contrast and separation between your head and your background. Look for this in movies. You're going to see it all the time now that you know about it.

Number two, a key principle in motion design is called easing. This is acceleration and deceleration, which looks a lot more natural than linear motion. And this can be improved further by deforming the thing being animated at the start and the end of the movement.

Disney animators do this all the time. Pay attention to that when you watch your next Disney animated film. Number three, microphones have different polar patterns, areas around the mic where sound is picked up or rejected.

Additionally, the tube of a shotgun microphone can increase reverberations, i.e. bad echoes, in indoor spaces. This is why pro sound operators in Hollywood often use hypercardioid mics in indoor settings instead of traditional shotgun mics.

Number four, there's a type of cut called a J-cut in editing. Instead of cutting the audio and video between two shots at the same time, the audio is cut before the video by just a few frames. When done right, this actually feels more natural to the viewer, even though they often can't say why.

Number five, ducking is a concept in sound design that involves reducing the volume of background music when the person in the shot is speaking. You can even automate this and it will make things sound a whole lot better. All five of these things help me make better videos.

Not perfect videos, mind you, but better ones. And I didn't know about any of them when I was starting out. I also didn't know about 10,000 other things that I now know.

Tech details that help me operate expensive cinema cameras, nervous system improvements that let me get better shots with a gimbal, set design knowledge that tells me where to put lights in the background of a shot, editing tricks that make videos much more entertaining. When I was starting out, I had no idea about any of this stuff. So how the heck was I ever going to make that perfect video?

Perfection is a pipe dream. You don't know what you don't know. And there's a million things out there that can make your next video 10 times better.

So the only useful goal is to make something better than last time. Okay, so here's how to pick what to work on, how to pick what to improve on. How do you decide which of these things to improve on with each video?

Well, simple, you follow your interests. Content creation is not a short term game. Building an audience and a body of impressive work both take time.

You have to love it or you're going to burn out. So one way that I've kept my interest in making content high over the past 11 years is by constantly looking for ways to get better. And a primary way that I do this is by watching other people's content.

When I see something I like, my brain often goes, hey, how the heck did they do that? And then I go figure out how. And I can give you a whole laundry list of areas in which you could improve.

Maybe I will in a different article, but the key principle here is to follow your interest. This is exactly what I've done. One week I'll be interested in set design.

The next I'm interested in learning how to apply EQ and compression to improve my audio. Another week I'm figuring out how to animate text in After Effects to make a quote look cooler. 1%, 1%, 1%, every single time.

It's a 1% improvement. And over time, these little improvements add up and suddenly you're knowledgeable about those 10,000 things you didn't know about before.
